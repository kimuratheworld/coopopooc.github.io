Summary: Using Durable Functions to query multiple containers in CosmosDB.

## Overview
Although Microsoft's official documentation of CosmosDB & Azure Functions is pretty good, it did not help me when trying to query multiple containers using the SQL API in CosmosDB. Even though I was able to find some guidance from non-Microsoft sources (specifically Stack Overflow, forum/discussion posts, Github), most of the code I found were not written in Python, which is the language I'm most comfortable with and the language that we wrote our Azure Functions in. 

Call it naivety or ignorance, but it was much easier to frankenstein the code I found into Python than learn the language it was written in by the original author. So, I set out to create a guide for others trying to do the same in Python, hence this blog post. 

This guide assumes that the reader has already set up some important **prerequisites**: a Microsft Azure account, a CosmosDB account using SQL API, and an Azure Function app. 

Assuming you've got the prerequisites set up already, let's get started.
